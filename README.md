# Project: Analysis of Airbnb Data Using Power BI
I'm exploring data to understand user experiences. By analyzing district scores, correlating host response times with ratings, and visualizing listing prices, I aim to create a concise City Insights Report. Focusing on 2020 changes, this project provides a nuanced perspective on Airbnb's data dynamics.
